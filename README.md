# LabviewExpSetupControl
This vi was written by Tobias Kennerknecht and can be used to control complex experimental setups by menas of an National Instruments FPGA based D/A PCIe board. It allows for up to 8 inputs and 8 outputs with 16 bits. The input data, e.g. from a load cell, strain sensors or others can be used to treat and process on the FPGA and the output can be used to drive actuators, e.g. piezos or spindel driven motors. A Description of the implementation can be found at in the thesis of Tobias Kennerknecht: https://www.ksp.kit.edu/9783731502937. Chris Eberl has contributed intelectually by in-depth discussions on solutions as well as keeping the focus in the projects.
